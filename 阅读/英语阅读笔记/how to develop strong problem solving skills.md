# How to develop strong problem solving skills as a software developer



### Introduction

It is generally known that problem solving is an essential skill for software engineers.

Good problem solving skills involve being able to think creatively and analytically, breaking down problems into smaller parts and using a systematic approach to find solutions. Strong problem solving skills are essential for a successful career in software development.

> 好的解决问题能力可以更有创造性和逻辑性，将问题拆解成小块并且使用系统性的方法找到答案。强大的解决问题的能力对于软件开发者来说是成功生涯的必备。

In this article we will review some approach.

### Various Methods

## Trial and Error method

The trial and error method is a common problem-solving technique in which potential solutions are tried out one by one until a working solution is found. This method can be used for both simple and complex problems.

For example, if a child is trying to figure out how to open a toy box, he or she may try various methods (e.g., pulling, pushing, lifting) until the correct one is found. Similarly, a software engineer may try different approaches to solving a programming problem until a working solution is found.
This can be effective, but it can also be time consuming and frustrating.



## Divide and conquer

> 分而治之

Another approach is to use a more systematic method, such as divide and conquer or reduction.
Divide and conquer is a software engineering technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

> 分而治之是一个软件工程师技能，用来将复杂的问题拆解成更小的更易于管理的片段

This allows for more efficient and effective problem solving by breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
Once these sub-problems have been solved, they can be combined to solve the larger, more complex problem.

One common example of divide and conquer is the use of recursion. Recursion involves breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem, and then combining the solutions to the sub-problems to solve the larger problem.

> 一个比较一般的分而治之的例子是使用递归。递归将问题拆解成更小的子问题，解决每一个子问题并且合并子问题的解决方案来解决更大的问题。

Another common example is the use of algorithms `算法`, such as the quick sort algorithm, which break a problem down into smaller pieces, solving each piece, and then combining the solutions to the pieces to solve the larger problem.

Once a solution is found, it is important to learn from the experience and use that knowledge to improve future problem solving skills. This includes understanding what went wrong, what could have been done better, and how similar problems can be avoided in the future.

> 一旦解决思路被找到了，总结经验以及在未来问题中使用是很重要的。这包括去理解什么出现问题了，哪里可以做的更好，怎样相似的问题可以在未来得到解决。

By taking these steps, software developers can become more effective problem solvers.

Problem solving skills is important in its own way. As a software developer, you should try to develop all of these skills in order to be successful.

## Analytical skills:

Analytical skills are the ability to collect and analyze data, identify patterns and trends, and make decisions based on that information. They involve both logical and creative thinking, as well as the ability to pay attention to detail. Strong analytical skills are important in many different fields.

> 分析是一项通过收集和分析信息，鉴定模式和趋势并最终根据已知信息做出决定的技能。这即包括了创造性思维也需要将注意集中于细节的能力。强大的分析技能在很多不同的领域都很重要。

Some examples:

- Being able to break down a problem and identify the various components
- Being able to identify patterns and trends
- Being able to see relationships between different pieces of data
- Being able to make decisions based on data
- Being able to solve complex problems

## Creative thinking

Creative thinking in computer science is all about coming up with new and innovative ways to solve problems. It’s about thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions that nobody has thought of before.

It’s important to be creative in computer science because it’s a constantly evolving field. If you’re not constantly coming up with new ideas, you’re going to fall behind. Creative thinking is what keeps computer science moving forward.

这对于计算机科学是很重要的，因为这是不断革新的领域，如果你没有不断的冒出新点子，那么你就会落后。创新思维保持计算机科学向前发展。

If you want to be successful in computer science, you need to be creative. It’s not enough to just learn the basics. You need to be constantly thinking of new and better ways to do things. So if you’re not a naturally creative person, don’t worry. Just keep working at it and you’ll get there.

## Logical reasoning 

Logical reasoning is a process of making deductions based on given information. In computer science, this process is often used to solve problems and to create new algorithms. To reason logically, one must first identify the premises and then use them to reach a valid conclusion.

逻辑推理是一个基于给出的信息进行推理的过程.... （To reason logically）使用逻辑推理，第一步一定要知晓前提并且使用他们获取有效结论。

### Conclusion

Practice is one of the best ways to improve your problem solving skills.
You can do this by working on coding challenges, participating in online coding contests, or simply trying to solve problems you encounter `遭遇` in your daytoday work.
Collaboration is another great way to improve your problem solving skills. When you work with others, you can learn from their experiences and share your own insights. This can help you develop a more well rounded approach to problem solving.

协作是另一种有效提升你解决问题能力的方式。和其他人合作的时候你可以从别人的经历中学习并且分享你的观点。这可以帮助你形成（develop 开发 这里翻译成形成）更加全面的问题解决方法。

If you're a software developer, congratulations! You have chosen one of the most mentally demanding professions there is. `你选择了对精神脑力要求最高的职业之一` And if you want to be successful, you need to have strong problem solving skills.

My last tip: get comfortable with being stuck! It's normal to feel stuck when you're trying to solve a problem and don't be afraid to ask for help. We all need help from time to time, and there's no shame in admitting that you need help.

So there you have it! Follow these tips and you'll be well on your way to developing strong problem solving skills as a software developer.
